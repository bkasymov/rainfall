writing to buff one by one byte, 66 symbols from fd
	fread(buf, 1, 66, fd);
closing buf wiht '\0'
Reading with atoi our arg
    buf[atoi(argv[1])] = '\0';
Moving to cell 66 and reading again text from fd
without closing it with '\0'
	fread(buf + 66, 1, 65, fd);
close fd
compare argv[1] with content of /home/user/end/.pass
after it implementing bash.
and writing buf[66] and go on.

Here is not overflow of buff than to read it.

In string below we see that here is setting
position to buff through atoi of our argument.
If we write like arg empty string, this empty
string return 0 in atoi and will be equal with
'\0'. Therefore strcmp will return 0.
	buf[atoi(argv[1])] = '\0';

Therefore, if we write 
./bonus3 ''  <--- with empty string, it will
enter us to sh of root.

$ cat /home/user/end/.pass
